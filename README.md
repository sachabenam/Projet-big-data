Is it useful to use the reducer class as a combiner ? Justify
The combiner is also known as semi reducer. The features of a reducer and a combiner are the same.
However a combiner can be different of a reducer, even if the combiner will always implement the reducer interface.
Combiners can not be used in specific cases which will depend work. The combiner function as a reducer,
but only on the subset of output Key / Value Mapper. Furthermore The combiner will have a constraint which is that key and value type must
match the type of the output Mapper.
So The reducer us allows to be more flexible and we think it may be more advantageous to use.
